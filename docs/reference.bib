	abstract = {Mindboggle (http://mindboggle.info) is an open source brain morphometry platform that takes in preprocessed T1-weighted {MRI} data and outputs volume, surface, and tabular data containing label, feature, and shape information for further analysis. In this article, we document the software and demonstrate its use in studies of shape variation in healthy and diseased humans. The number of different shape measures and the size of the populations make this the largest and most detailed shape analysis of human brains ever conducted. Brain image morphometry shows great potential for providing much-needed biological markers for diagnosing, tracking, and predicting progression of mental health disorders. Very few software algorithms provide more than measures of volume and cortical thickness, while more subtle shape measures may provide more sensitive and specific biomarkers. Mindboggle computes a variety of (primarily surface-based) shapes: area, volume, thickness, curvature, depth, Laplace-Beltrami spectra, Zernike moments, etc. We evaluate Mindboggle’s algorithms using the largest set of manually labeled, publicly available brain images in the world and compare them against state-of-the-art algorithms where they exist. All data, code, and results of these evaluations are publicly available.},

	abstract = {The development of magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) techniques has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional {MRI} and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that {MRI} is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure ({BIDS}), a standard for organizing and describing {MRI} datasets. The {BIDS} standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

	abstract = {The rate of progress in human neurosciences is limited by the inability to easily apply a wide range of analysis methods to the plethora of different datasets acquired in labs around the world. In this work, we introduce a framework for creating, testing, versioning and archiving portable applications for analyzing neuroimaging data organized and described in compliance with the Brain Imaging Data Structure ({BIDS}). The portability of these applications ({BIDS} Apps) is achieved by using container technologies that encapsulate all binary and other dependencies in one convenient package. {BIDS} Apps run on all three major operating systems with no need for complex setup and configuration and thanks to the comprehensiveness of the {BIDS} standard they require little manual user input. Previous containerized data processing solutions were limited to single user environments and not compatible with most multi-tenant High Performance Computing systems. {BIDS} Apps overcome this limitation by taking advantage of the Singularity container technology. As a proof of concept, this work is accompanied by 22 ready to use {BIDS} Apps, packaging a diverse set of commonly used neuroimaging algorithms.},
